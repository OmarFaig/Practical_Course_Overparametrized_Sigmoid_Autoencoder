# Associative Memory in Iterated Overparameterized Sigmoid Autoencoders
In this repository you can find the source code and results of the "Practical Course Practical Course - Analysis of new phenomena in machine/deep learning" where I reproduced the results of "Associative Memory in Iterated Overparameterized Sigmoid Autoencoders(Yibo Jiang, Cengiz Pehlevan)" and did additional experiments.
